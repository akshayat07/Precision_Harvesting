# PRECISION üåø
#### a simplistic website that uses ML and DL to suggest the best crops to produce, the fertilisers to use, and the diseases your crops are susceptible to.


## DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è
This project is a The source of the information used here makes no guarantees about it. So, avoid using it when making farming decisions. The developer will have no liability if you do this. Yet, this study demonstrates how, if developed at scale and using genuine and confirmed data, ML/DL may be used in precision farming.

## MOTIVATION üí™
- One of the key industries that affects a nation's economic development is agriculture.

- The majority of people in countries like India rely on agriculture for their livelihood. Several new technologies are being incorporated into agriculture to make it simpler for farmers to cultivate and increase their production, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

- In this project, I show a website that integrates three applications: one for crop suggestion, one for fertiliser recommendation, and one for plant disease prediction.

- In the crop recommendation application, the user can input their own soil data and the programme will advise them on which crop to produce.

- The user can input soil data and the crop kind they are growing for the fertiliser recommendation application.




## How to run locally üõ†Ô∏è
- Before the following steps make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/download), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system
- Clone the complete project with `git clone https://github.com/akshayat07/Precision_Harvesting` or you can just download the code and unzip it
- Once the project is cloned, open anaconda prompt in the directory where the project was cloned and paste the following block
  ```
  conda create -n precision python=3.6.12
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  conda activate precision
  ```
- And finally run the project with
  ```
  python app.py
  ```
- Open the localhost url provided after running `app.py` and now you can use the project locally in your web browser.
